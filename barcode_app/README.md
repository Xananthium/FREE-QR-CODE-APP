## The Story

It was my daughter's sixth birthday party. I wanted to make it special, so I designed these cute little flyers with all the party details—balloons, cake, presents, the works. And then I had an idea: wouldn't it be great to put a QR code on the flyers? Something the parents could scan to get the Google Maps link to our house. Simple. Convenient. Modern.

I went online and found a website that said it was "free." Perfect! I generated the QR code, downloaded it, and printed it on all the invitations. Handed them out at school. Posted them around the neighborhood. Didn't think anything of it.

Three days later, I got an email.

*"Your QR code will expire in 24 hours unless you upgrade to our Premium plan."*

**$30 per year.** To keep a QR code working. A QR code I'd already printed on dozens of invitations that were now in the hands of my daughter's classmates and their parents.

I didn't buy the membership.

The calls started coming in: *"Hey, the QR code on the invitation doesn't work."* I had to text everyone the address manually. My daughter asked why some of her friends weren't coming to her party. I had to explain that some parents couldn't find our house.

**Never again.**
