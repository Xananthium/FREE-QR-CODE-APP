# The Digital Disconnections Anti-Rent License

**Version 1.0, January 2026**

**"You shouldn't have to rent your own phone."**

## Preamble

This software was created after a father was held hostage by a "free" QR code service that demanded $30/year to keep his daughter's birthday party invitations working.

We believe QR codes—and the software to create them—should be free. Forever. No subscriptions. No expiring links. No data collection. No rent-seeking.

## License Terms

Permission is hereby granted, **free of charge**, to any person, organization, or entity obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the Software, subject to the following conditions:

### 1. The Anti-Rent Clause

**You may not charge anyone, directly or indirectly, for the generation of QR codes.**

This means:
- ❌ You cannot charge a fee to generate a QR code
- ❌ You cannot put QR code generation behind a paywall
- ❌ You cannot require a subscription to generate QR codes
- ❌ You cannot make QR codes expire to force payment
- ❌ You cannot limit QR code generation to "premium" users

However, you **CAN**:
- ✅ Use this software commercially in your business
- ✅ Include QR code generation in a product you sell (e.g., invitation design software, business card creators, restaurant menu builders)
- ✅ Charge for products that *contain* QR codes (invitations, business cards, menus, posters, etc.)
- ✅ Charge for design services, printing, or other services where QR codes are a component
- ✅ Charge for additional features unrelated to QR code generation (cloud storage, team collaboration, advanced analytics of QR scans, etc.)

**Examples:**

✅ **ALLOWED:**
- "Our invitation design app costs $9.99, and you can generate unlimited QR codes for your invitations."
- "We charge $50 to design and print your business cards, which include a QR code."
- "Our restaurant menu service costs $29/month and includes unlimited QR code generation."

❌ **NOT ALLOWED:**
- "Generate 5 QR codes for free, then pay $4.99/month for unlimited."
- "Your QR codes will expire after 30 days unless you upgrade to Premium."
- "QR code generation costs $0.10 per code."

### 3. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

## Enforcement

If you violate the Anti-Rent Clause, you lose all rights granted by this license. We will:
1. Ask you nicely to stop
2. If you don't stop, we'll tell everyone you're rent-seeking from QR codes
3. If you still don't stop, we'll use whatever legal remedies are available

But honestly, we'd rather you just not charge people for QR codes. They're static images. They should be free.

## Why This License?

Most software licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) allow companies to take free software and lock it behind paywalls. That's fine for most software.

But QR codes are different. QR codes are meant to be shared. They're printed on physical objects. They're given to people. And when a "free" QR service suddenly demands payment to keep your QR codes working, it's not just annoying—it's cruel.

This happened to real people. It happened to birthday parties, weddings, business cards, restaurant menus, and fundraisers. People who thought they were using a "free" service, only to find their QR codes held hostage.

This license exists to prevent that from happening again.

## Legal Note

This license is based on the MIT License but with the additional Anti-Rent Clause. If the Anti-Rent Clause is deemed unenforceable in your jurisdiction, the remaining terms of this license shall remain in effect, but you acknowledge that you are morally obligated not to charge people for generating QR codes.
