## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is this really free forever?**

A: Yes. Completely free. No trials, no subscriptions, no "premium" versions. We built this app because we got scammed by a "free" QR code service that held our codes hostage. We're not going to do that to you.

**Q: How do you make money?**

A: We don't (from this app). Digital Disconnections is a mission-driven company. We believe good software should exist without exploitation. This app is our contribution to a better internet.

**Q: Will you ever add ads or subscriptions?**

A: Never. The moment we add ads or subscriptions, we become the thing we set out to replace. That's not going to happen.

**Q: Do my QR codes expire?**

A: Never. QR codes are just encoded data. Once generated, they work forever. We don't host your data on a server that could go down or require payment to stay active. The code IS the data.

---

### Privacy & Security

**Q: What data do you collect?**

A: Nothing. Zero. None. We don't have servers, we don't have analytics, we don't track you. Read our full [Privacy Policy](link-to-privacy-policy).

**Q: Can you see what QR codes I create?**

A: No. Everything happens on your device. We never see your data because we never receive your data.

**Q: Is my data backed up anywhere?**

A: Not by us. Your QR codes are stored locally on your device. If you want to back them up, save them to your photo library and back up your photos however you normally do.

**Q: Do you use third-party analytics?**

A: No. No Google Analytics, no Firebase, no Mixpanel, no tracking SDKs of any kind. The app is completely self-contained.

**Q: Can I use this for sensitive information?**

A: The app itself is safe (we don't collect data), but remember: **anyone who scans a QR code can see what's in it.** Don't encode passwords, credit card numbers, or other secrets in a QR code unless you want anyone with a scanner to see them.

### Features & Usage

**Q: What types of QR codes can I create?**

A:
- URLs & Websites
- Contact Cards (vCard)
- WiFi Credentials
- Plain Text
- Email addresses
- Phone numbers
- SMS messages
- Calendar events
- Geographic locations

**Q: Can I customize the QR code?**

A: Yes! You can choose:
- Size (small, medium, large, custom)
- Color (black, or custom colors)
- Error correction level (low, medium, high)
- Output format (PNG, JPEG, SVG)

**Q: Does it work offline?**

A: Yes! Generate QR codes without an internet connection. Perfect for travel, remote locations, or privacy-conscious users.

**Q: Can I create QR codes in bulk?**

A: Yes, batch creation is supported. Create multiple codes quickly and efficiently.

**Q: Where are my QR codes saved?**

A: In the app's local database on your device. You can also save them to your photo library for easy access and sharing.

**Q: Can I edit a QR code after creating it?**

A: No. QR codes are fixed once generated (the data is literally encoded in the pattern). But you can always create a new one with updated information.

**Q: Will my QR codes work in all scanners?**

A: Yes. We generate standard QR codes that work with any compliant scanner (iPhone camera, Android camera, dedicated scanner apps, etc.).

### Technical Questions

**Q: What platforms does it support?**

A: iPhone and iPad running iOS 13 or later. Android version coming soon.

**Q: Does it require special permissions?**

A: Only photo library access (if you want to save codes to your photos). No location, no contacts, no tracking permissions.

**Q: How large can my data be?**

A: QR codes can hold up to ~4,000 alphanumeric characters (depending on error correction level). Practical limit is usually 500-1,000 characters for easy scanning.

**Q: What's the difference between error correction levels?**

A:
- **Low (7%):** Smaller code, less damage tolerance
- **Medium (15%):** Good balance (recommended)
- **High (30%):** Larger code, works even if partially damaged

**Q: Can I generate dynamic QR codes that I can update later?**

A: No. Dynamic QR codes require a server to redirect URLs, which would mean:
1. We'd need to track your codes
2. We'd need to charge for server costs
3. Your codes could stop working if we shut down

That's exactly what we're trying to avoid. We only generate static QR codes that work forever.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app crashes when I try to create a code. What do I do?**

A:
1. Make sure you're running the latest version
2. Restart the app
3. Restart your device
4. If it still crashes, email us with:
   - Your device model
   - iOS version
   - What you were trying to create when it crashed

**Q: My QR code won't scan. Why?**

A: Check these:
- Is the code printed clearly (no blur, no distortion)?
- Is there enough white space around the code?
- Is the scanner's camera lens clean?
- Is there enough light?
- Try a different scanner app

If the code scans fine with other scanners but not one specific app, it's likely an issue with that scanner, not your QR code.

**Q: The WiFi QR code doesn't work on my friend's phone. Why?**

A: Make sure:
- The WiFi password is correct
- The network name (SSID) is correct
- Their phone supports WiFi QR code scanning (iOS 11+, Android 10+)
- They're scanning from the camera app, not a third-party scanner

**Q: Can I restore deleted QR codes?**

A: If you saved them to your photo library, yes (they're just images). If you only kept them in the app and didn't back up your device, no (they're deleted when you delete the app).

## Feature Requests

**Q: Will you add [feature X]?**

A: Maybe! We prioritize features that:
1. Don't require servers or data collection
2. Don't add subscriptions or payments
3. Are genuinely useful to many users
4. Keep the app simple and focused

Email us your feature ideas: support@digitaldisconnections.com

**Q: Can you add a QR code scanner?**

A: Maybe in a future update. For now, your iPhone's camera app already scans QR codes perfectly—just point it at a code and tap the notification.

**Q: Can you add cloud sync?**

A: No. Cloud sync would require:
- Servers (which cost money and create privacy risks)
- User accounts (tracking and data collection)
- Potential subscription fees

That goes against our core mission.

**Q: Will you add templates (like for business cards)?**

A: Possibly! Templates that work offline and don't require data collection could be added.

## Our Story

This app exists because I got scammed.

It was my daughter's sixth birthday party and I thought it would be cute to put a QR code on the invitations with a Google Maps link to the venue. I used a "free" QR code website. Made the code, printed 30 invitations, sent them out.

Three days later, I got an email: "If you want the code to stay active, buy a yearly membership for $30."

I didn't pay. The code stopped working. Half the guests called asking for directions.

I was furious. Not about the $30—about the deception. About making something that should be simple into a subscription trap.

So I built this app. It's free. It works forever. It collects nothing. It's what I needed that day.

If you've been burned by similar scams, you're not alone. We built this for you.
