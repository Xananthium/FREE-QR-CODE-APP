🟡 Didn't know this was a thing

Replies welcomed.
```

- Post: "QR Code Services That Hold Your Codes Hostage - A Warning"
- Share the birthday party story
- DON'T mention your app yet (builds credibility)

---

### Day -3: Story Share

**Twitter/X (Thread):**
```
1/ It was my daughter's 6th birthday party. I made QR codes for the invitations with a Google Maps link to the venue.

Used a "free" website. Made the code. Printed 30 invitations. Sent them out.

Then I got an email.

2/ "Your QR code will stop working in 24 hours unless you upgrade to Premium for $30/year."

I was furious. Not about the $30—about the deception.

I didn't pay. The code stopped working. Guests couldn't find the party.

Never. Again.

3/ That's why I built something different.

Launching [Day of Week].

Free forever. Works offline. Never expires. Collects nothing.

You shouldn't have to rent your phone.
```

Announcing Digital Disconnections' first product: QR Code Generator 🚀

After experiencing the predatory "free-to-paid" model firsthand (my daughter's birthday party QR codes were held hostage for $30/year), I decided to build an alternative.

This app represents a different approach to software:
✅ Completely free (no subscriptions)
✅ Zero data collection (no surveillance model)
✅ Works offline (no server dependency)
✅ Mission-driven (proving ethical software can exist)

Our philosophy: "You shouldn't have to rent your own phone."

This is just the beginning. More privacy-first, user-respecting tools coming in 2026.

### Day 3: Privacy Deep Dive

**Twitter/X (Thread):**
```
1/ How we built privacy into every layer:

No servers = No data storage
No accounts = No user tracking
No analytics = No behavior monitoring

2/ What we DON'T collect:

❌ Name
❌ Email
❌ Location
❌ Device info
❌ QR code content
❌ Usage patterns
❌ Crash reports
❌ Anything

3/ Compare to typical "free" app:

Them:
- 37 tracking SDKs
- Sells data to 142 partners
- Privacy policy is 12,000 words

Us:
- 0 tracking SDKs
- Sells data to 0 partners
- Privacy policy is "We collect nothing"

## Ongoing Content Strategy

### Weekly Themes

**Monday:** Motivational/Mission
```
"You shouldn't have to rent your phone."

Share if you believe software should work for you, not against you.

[App Store link]
```

**Tuesday:** Tip/Tutorial
```
QR Code Tip #1:

Use error correction level "High" if your code will be:
- Printed small
- On textured surfaces
- Potentially damaged

This lets the code work even if 30% is obscured.

[Screenshot demonstrating]
```

**Wednesday:** Comparison/Education
```
Dynamic vs Static QR codes explained:

Dynamic:
- Redirects through a server
- Can be updated
- Can expire or require payment
- Tracks all scans

Static (what we use):
- Data encoded in code itself
- Can't be updated
- Works forever
- Completely private

[Infographic]
```

**Thursday:** User Story/Testimonial
```
User story:

"I use this for my coffee shop menus. Knowing they'll never expire or demand payment is huge peace of mind."

— Sarah, Coffee Shop Owner

Use case: [Link to support page]
```

**Friday:** Behind the Scenes
```
Building in public:

This week I [worked on X feature / fixed Y bug / learned Z lesson].

Transparency is part of our mission.

Follow along 👇
```

**Saturday:** Community/Engagement
```
Weekend question:

What's the most creative use for a QR code you've seen?

Best answer gets featured next week.

Reply below 👇
```

**Sunday:** Reflection/Philosophy
```
Sunday thought:

Free software doesn't have to mean "free until we change our mind."

It can just mean... free.

That's our commitment.

Your mission is clear: "You shouldn't have to rent your phone." Every post should reinforce this.

Your advantage is authenticity: You're not a corporation pretending to care about privacy. You're a person who got scammed and built the solution.

**Be real. Be consistent. Be trustworthy.**

Good luck! 🚀
