## The Story (For Media)

### The Problem

Every day, millions of people use "free" QR code generators online. What they don't realize is that these services often hold codes hostage—working initially, then demanding payment to keep them active.

### The Catalyst

It was the founder's daughter's sixth birthday party. He created a QR code for the party invitations using a "free" website, linking to the venue's location on Google Maps. Three days later, an email arrived: "$30/year to keep your code active—or it stops working."

He didn't pay. The code died. Guests couldn't find the party. Kids cried. Parents called asking for directions.

"Never again," he thought.

### The Solution

QR Code Generator by Digital Disconnections is different:
- **Free forever** - no subscriptions, no hidden costs
- **Codes never expire** - they work permanently
- **Complete privacy** - zero data collection
- **Works offline** - no internet required
- **No ads** - clean, focused experience

It's the app he wished existed that day.

## Quotes

### From the Founder
> "I built this app because I got scammed. My daughter's birthday party invitations had QR codes that stopped working three days after I printed them. The company wanted $30/year to turn them back on. That's not how software should work."

> "You shouldn't have to rent your own phone. This app is free, it works forever, and it collects zero data. That's not a business model—it's a statement."

> "Every 'free' service that later demands payment is eroding trust in technology. We're trying to restore that trust, one app at a time."

### From Early Users (hypothetical - replace with real quotes post-launch)
> "Finally, a QR code app that doesn't feel like a trap." - Sarah M., Event Planner

> "I use this for my restaurant menus. Knowing the codes will never expire gives me peace of mind." - James K., Restaurant Owner

> "The fact that it works offline and doesn't track me sold me immediately." - Alex R., Privacy Advocate

## Press Release (Ready to Use)

### FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**New QR Code Generator Promises No Expiration, No Tracking, No Cost—Forever**

*Digital Disconnections launches privacy-first app after founder's daughter's birthday party invitations were held hostage by "free" QR service*

**[Your City, State] – [Launch Date]** – Digital Disconnections Inc. today announced the launch of its QR Code Generator app for iOS, a completely free, privacy-first tool that generates QR codes that never expire and collects zero user data.

The app was born from frustration. Founder [Your Name] created QR codes for his daughter's sixth birthday party invitations using a "free" online service. Three days later, the service demanded $30 per year to keep the codes active. When he refused to pay, the codes stopped working, leaving guests unable to find the party venue.

"That experience was infuriating," said [Your Name]. "Not because of the money, but because of the deception. I built this app to be what I needed that day: a QR code generator that actually works, forever, with no strings attached."

Unlike competitors, the QR Code Generator:
- Works completely offline with no internet connection required
- Generates codes that never expire or require payment
- Collects zero data—no analytics, no tracking, no cloud storage
- Contains no advertisements
- Requires no user accounts or subscriptions

"You shouldn't have to rent your own phone," added [Your Name]. "We believe software should work for you, not surveil you or extract recurring payments. This app proves that model can exist."

The app supports all standard QR code types including URLs, contact cards (vCard), WiFi credentials, email addresses, SMS messages, calendar events, and geographic locations. Users can customize size, color, and error correction levels, and save codes in PNG, JPEG, or SVG formats.

Digital Disconnections Inc. is a mission-driven software company focused on creating privacy-first, ad-free alternatives to surveillance-based apps. The QR Code Generator is its first release, with more ethical software tools planned for 2026.

The app is available now as a free download on the App Store for iPhone and iPad.

## Background Information

### The QR Code Scam Industry

Many "free" QR code services employ a bait-and-switch model:

1. **Bait:** Free QR code generation
2. **Switch:** Codes are "dynamic" (redirect through the service's servers)
3. **Trap:** After codes are printed/distributed, service demands payment to keep them active
4. **Result:** Users pay ransom or codes break

**How common is this?**
Industry estimates suggest 60-70% of online QR code generators use some form of expiration or payment requirement. Many don't disclose this until after codes are created.

**Why it works:**
Once a QR code is printed on thousands of flyers, menus, or product labels, the cost to reprint is prohibitive. Users feel forced to pay.

**Why it's problematic:**
- Deceptive marketing ("free" isn't free)
- Creates vendor lock-in
- Unreliable (if service shuts down, all codes break)
- Privacy concerns (all scans tracked)

### How This App Is Different

**Static QR codes:**
The data is encoded directly in the QR pattern. No server intermediary. Once generated, they work forever—even if Digital Disconnections ceases to exist.

**No business model dependency:**
Because there's no server infrastructure to maintain, there are no ongoing costs to pass to users.

**Open standard:**
Uses the ISO/IEC 18004 QR Code standard, ensuring compatibility with all scanners.

## Industry Context

### Market Size
- Global QR code usage grew 300% during pandemic
- 89% of smartphone users have scanned a QR code (2023)

### Competition
- Online generators: QR Code Generator, Beaconstac, QR Code Monkey

- Built-in: Some apps include QR generation (limited features)

**Differentiation:**
Digital Disconnections is the only major player promising:
- Zero data collection
- No expiration
- Complete offline functionality
- No monetization model

## FAQ for Journalists

**Q: How do you make money if the app is free with no ads?**
A: We don't monetize this app. Digital Disconnections is funded by its founders as a mission-driven project. Think of it as open-source philosophy applied to mobile apps.

**Q: Is this sustainable?**
A: Because the app has no servers and no ongoing costs, yes. We're not burning cash to stay alive. The only cost is development time, which we've already invested.

**Q: Will you ever add ads or subscriptions?**
A: No. That would undermine the entire reason we built this. Our mission is to prove ethical software can exist.

**Q: What if the app gets hugely popular and you need to scale?**
A: There's nothing to scale. No servers, no infrastructure. The app runs entirely on-device.

**Q: How can users trust you're not secretly collecting data?**
A: The app works offline, proving it doesn't need to "phone home." We'll also open-source the code for security audits (considering).

**Q: What's next for Digital Disconnections?**
A: More privacy-first, ad-free tools. We're exploring PDF readers, note-taking apps, and other utilities that shouldn't require surveillance.

**Q: Can I invest in or support Digital Disconnections?**
A: Not currently seeking investment. If you want to support the mission, use the app and spread the word.
