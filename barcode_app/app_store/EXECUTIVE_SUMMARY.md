## Your Core Message

**Tagline:** "You shouldn't have to rent your own phone."

**Value Proposition:** Create QR codes that work forever—no subscriptions, no expiring links, no data collection.

**Mission:** Prove ethical software can exist without ads, tracking, or subscriptions.

---

## Key Differentiators

1. **Free Forever** - No trials, no subscriptions, no upsells
2. **Never Expires** - Codes work permanently (static, not dynamic)
3. **Complete Privacy** - Zero data collection, no tracking, no analytics
4. **Works Offline** - No internet required (proves no tracking)
5. **No Ads** - Clean, focused experience

---
