# Privacy Policy

**For: QR Code Generator by Digital Disconnections Inc.**
**Effective Date:** January 29, 2026
**Website:** https://digitaldisconnections.com

---

## The Short Version

**We collect nothing. We track nothing. We store nothing.**

Everything you do in this app stays on your device. We don't have servers, we don't have analytics, and we don't have any way to see what you're doing.

That's it. That's the policy.

---

## The Slightly Longer Version

### What We Collect

**Nothing.**

We don't collect:
- Your name
- Your email
- Your location
- Your device information
- Your QR code data
- Your usage patterns
- Analytics of any kind
- Crash reports
- Anything else

### What We Store

**Nothing on our servers, because we don't have servers.**

All QR codes you create are stored locally on your device. We never see them. We never have access to them. We don't want access to them.

If you delete the app, all your QR codes are deleted with it (unless you've saved them to your photo library, which is entirely under your control).

### What We Share

**Nothing, because we don't have anything to share.**

We don't sell data to third parties because we don't collect data.
We don't share data with partners because we don't have data.
We don't give data to advertisers because we don't run ads.

### Third-Party Services

**We use zero third-party services.**

No analytics services (like Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
No advertising networks (like AdMob, Facebook Ads, etc.)
No crash reporting tools (like Crashlytics, Sentry, etc.)
No cloud storage services (like AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
No authentication services (like Auth0, Firebase Auth, etc.)

The app is completely self-contained.

### Permissions We Request

The app may request permission to:

1. **Photo Library Access** - Only to save QR codes you create to your photos. We never read photos that already exist. We only write QR codes you explicitly save.

2. **Camera Access** - Only if we add a scanner feature in the future. Not used in the current version.

That's it. No location, no contacts, no microphone, no tracking.

### Children's Privacy

Because we don't collect any data from anyone, we also don't collect data from children. The app is safe for all ages.

We comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) by not collecting any information from anyone, including children under 13.

### Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Use the app without giving us any information (because we don't ask for any)
- Delete the app at any time (all data is local to your device)
- Request a copy of your data (there is none on our servers)
- Request deletion of your data (there is none on our servers)

### Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this policy, we'll update the "Effective Date" at the top and notify users through an app update.

We don't anticipate changing this policy because our core mission is privacy, but if we did, it would only be to add more protections, never to reduce them.

### International Users

This app works the same way for everyone, everywhere:
- We don't collect data from US users
- We don't collect data from EU users
- We don't collect data from users anywhere else

No servers = no data storage = no jurisdictional issues.

### GDPR Compliance

For users in the European Union:

We comply with GDPR by not processing any personal data whatsoever. There is no data controller because there is no data being controlled. There is no data processor because there is no data being processed.

You have all GDPR rights by default because we never have your data in the first place.

### CCPA Compliance

For users in California:

We comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act by not selling your personal information. We don't sell it because we don't collect it.

"Do Not Sell My Personal Information" is our default (and only) mode.

### Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at:

**Email:** privacy@digitaldisconnections.com
**Website:** https://digitaldisconnections.com
**Mail:** Digital Disconnections Inc., [Your Address]

But honestly, the answer to almost any privacy question is: "We don't collect any data."

## Our Philosophy

**"You shouldn't have to rent your own phone."**

We believe:
- Software should work for you, not surveil you
- Free should mean free, not "free in exchange for your data"
- Privacy should be the default, not a premium feature
- You shouldn't have to read a 10,000-word privacy policy to understand what an app does with your information

That's why our privacy policy is simple: **We don't collect anything.**

---

## Legal Disclaimer

This app is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. While we strive to make the best QR code generator possible, we can't guarantee:
- That QR codes will work in every scanner (though standard QR codes should)
- That the app will work perfectly on every device
- That there will never be bugs

What we CAN guarantee:
- We will never collect your data
- We will never sell your information
- We will never add ads or subscriptions
- We will always keep this app free and private

## Summary Box (for App Store "Privacy Practices" Section)

When Apple asks about privacy practices in App Store Connect:

### Data Linked to You
**None**

### Data Not Linked to You
**None**

### Privacy Details
```
No data collected.

Apple will show this as: **"No Data Collected"** with a green badge. This is the best possible privacy label.

## FAQ About Privacy

**Q: How do you make money if you don't collect data or run ads?**
A: We don't. This is a mission-driven project. We believe good software should exist without exploitation.

**Q: Will you ever add analytics "just to improve the app"?**
A: No. If we want feedback, we'll ask for it directly. We won't spy on usage.

**Q: What if I want to back up my QR codes?**
A: Save them to your photo library, and back up your photos however you normally do (iCloud, Google Photos, etc.). We're not involved in that process.

**Q: How can I trust you're not secretly collecting data?**
A:
1. We have no servers to send data to
2. The app works offline (proof we don't need internet)
3. Our code will be open for security audits (consider open-sourcing)
4. Our reputation is built on this promise

**Q: What about crash reports?**
A: We don't collect them. If you experience a crash, email us at support@digitaldisconnections.com and we'll help you troubleshoot.

**Q: Is this privacy policy legally binding?**
A: Yes. This is our commitment to you. If we ever violate it, you have legal recourse.

**The bottom line:** We built this app because we got burned by data-harvesting companies. We're not going to turn around and do the same thing to you.

Your privacy is safe with us because we never have your data in the first place.
