# Privacy Policy for Digital Eclipse QR Code Generator

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026

## Simple Truth

**We don't collect any data. Period.**

## What This Means

- No analytics
- No tracking
- No cloud storage
- No user accounts
- No data collection of any kind

Everything happens 100% on your device. Your QR codes, your data, your privacy.

## How It Works

Digital Eclipse is a client-side application. All QR code generation happens locally on your device. Nothing is ever sent to our servers because we don't have any servers.

**TL;DR:** We literally can't see your data because it never leaves your device.
